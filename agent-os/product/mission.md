# Product Mission

## Pitch

## The Problem

### Mortgage Conversion Funnel Blindness

Mortgage businesses lose significant revenue due to invisible drop-offs across the lead-to-disbursement funnel. Without a unified system, leads fall through cracks, eligibility assessments are inconsistent, and case progress stalls without visibility.

**Quantifiable Impact:** Industry averages show 60-70% of mortgage leads never convert, with most drop-offs occurring at undocumented stages.

**Our Solution:** A unified operating system that tracks every lead, client, and case through defined stages with clear ownership, SLA timers, and actionable dashboards for each role.

### Fragmented Entity Lifecycle

Most CRMs treat leads, clients, and deals as the same entity or lack clear conversion points. This creates confusion about ownership, status, and next actions.

**Our Solution:** Three distinct entities (Lead, Client, Case) with explicit conversion triggers, dedicated owners, and lifecycle-appropriate workflows.

## Core Entities

### Lead
- **Definition:** Raw signal from a marketing channel (form fill, ad click, referral)
- **Lifecycle:** Temporary — converts to Client or is dropped
- **Owner:** Campaign Owner
- **Key Actions:** Validate, qualify, convert or discard

### Client
- **Definition:** Verified person with mortgage intent; identity collected, eligibility calculated
- **Lifecycle:** Permanent — never deleted; "not ready" clients enter nurture
- **Owner:** Mortgage Specialist
- **Key Actions:** Collect identity, calculate eligibility, gather documents, qualify for case

### Case
- **Definition:** Active bank application for a specific property
- **Lifecycle:** Per transaction — ends in terminal state (approved, declined, withdrawn)
- **Owner:** Process Executive
- **Key Actions:** Lock deal details, submit to bank, track stages, close

## Differentiators

### Entity-First Architecture
Unlike generic CRMs that blur the line between leads and opportunities, Rivo OS enforces a clear Lead > Client > Case progression with distinct owners and workflows at each stage. This results in zero ambiguity about status, ownership, and next actions.

### Role-Specific Dashboards
Unlike one-size-fits-all dashboards, each persona (MS, PE, Manager) sees exactly what they need with relevant SLA timers, filters, and quick actions. This results in faster decision-making and reduced cognitive load.

### Built-In Eligibility Engine
Unlike systems requiring external calculators, Rivo OS includes native DBR/LTV calculations based on salary and liabilities. This results in instant eligibility assessment without spreadsheet workarounds.

### Immutable Audit Trail
Unlike systems with editable histories, every state change is logged immutably with actor, timestamp, and context. This results in complete compliance readiness and dispute resolution capability.
